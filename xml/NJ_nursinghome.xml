      <abstract>Data Source: New Jersey Geographic Information Network. HSIP New Jersey Nursing Homes 2010 NAD83 NJ State Plane feetThis dataset consists of nursing homes within study area, and was extrated from HSIP New Jersey Nursing Homes 2010 NAD83 NJ State Plane feet dataset. Nursing Homes A nursing home is commonly referred to as a skilled nursing facility, long term care (LTC) facility, or rest home, and may have a different standardized name throughout the United States, but is most commonly referred to as a nursing home. A nursing home traditionally offers 24-hour (skilled) nursing to the elderly or to disabled patients having a variety of medical conditions who require personal care services above that of an assisted living but do not require hospitalization. The personal care services provided may or may not include, but are not limited to: skilled nursing, long term inpatient care, room and board, meals, laundry, and assistance with: dressing, grooming, getting in and out of bed, medications, bathing, and toileting. For purposes of this dataset, an assisted living facility is defined as a facility where the elderly, who are not related to the operator, reside and receive care, treatment, or services. Although not at the level of a nursing home, the services are above the level of an independent living community. They may include several hours per week of supportive care, personal care, or nursing care per resident. Generally, an assisted living facility offers help in daily living (laundry, cooking, cleaning, etc.) and personal assistance (bathing, eating, clothing, etc.). Many assisted living facilities offer assistance with medication and a lesser level of nursing care than what is offered at a nursing home. Assisted living facilities may be regulated by size restrictions depending on which type of assisted living facility it is considered to be in the state in which it exists. For example, Adult Family Homes in Wisconsin have between 3-4 elderly residents while Community Based Residential Facilities have 5 or more. Almost every state has different terminology to describe their version of the assisted living facility system. The structures in which assisted living facilities exist are varied as well. Depending on the type, an assisted living facility may operate out of a personal residence or a nursing home style structure, and it may be set up as apartment style living or as a campus setting in a continuing care retirement community. Multiple assisted living facilities may exist at one location or may be co-located with nursing homes and/or other similar health care facilities. If a facility is licensed by a state and holds multiple licenses, it is represented once in this dataset for each license, even if the licenses are for the same location. This dataset does not include retirement communities, adult daycare facilities, or rehabilitation facilities. Nursing Homes that are operated by and co-located with a hospital are also excluded because the locations are included in the hospital dataset. Records with "-DOD" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. "#" and "*" characters were automatically removed from standard fields populated by TechniGraphics. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same fields. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based on this field, the oldest record dates from 12/29/2009 and the newest record dates from 01/08/2010.</abstract>

Use Cases: Use cases describe how the data may be used and help to define and clarify requirements.

1. A resource for evacuation planning and emergency management in the event of an emergency.

2. A threat against nursing homes has been identified and measures must be taken to protect these types of facilities.

3. A disaster has occurred, or is in the process of occurring, and facilities in the vicinity with people needing evacuation assistance must be identified.</purpose>

        <attrlabl>CITY</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>
The name of the city associated with the entity's physical address. For physical addresses that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivers to, this should be a "city" acceptable to the USPS as defined in their Address Information System (AIS). Sometimes the USPS does not deliver mail to a physical address but recognizes the location (i.e., they list the location as "undeliverable"). The cities associated with these locations are acceptable. In some cases, the USPS does not recognize individual physical addresses in a city; rather, they list the city as having "General Delivery". In these cases, the city and associated zip code are acceptable (the entity's [ADDRESS] field will contain a street address, not "general delivery"). The entity may not actually be located within the city limits of the "city" specified in its [CITY] field. Instead, it may actually be located within the city limits of another city. In some cases, the "city" that appears in this field may not even be a city in an administrative sense, but it is still an acceptable "city" to the USPS. An example of this is "Notre Dame, IN". There is no city in Indiana called "Notre Dame", but this is considered an acceptable city by the USPS for any delivery going to the University of Notre Dame which is actually located in the city of South Bend. "Notre Dame", like most USPS cities, is an easily recognized place, and it gives the user of the data a good general idea of where the entity is located (if the entity is located in a small municipality, the USPS "city" may be more recognizable than the name of the municipality), and it would be part of the address one would use to send a shipment to the entity's location. Using the USPS acceptable "city" also allows someone to do a logical consistency check between the zip code and the city by using the USPS AIS.

Sometimes an entity may report a city that is not accepted by the USPS, and although TechniGraphics has tried to replace those cities with an acceptable alternative, some of them may remain in this dataset.

However, there are cases, particularly where an entity is part of a larger facility that cuts across state lines, where the entity's location may be depicted in a state other than the one indicated in this field.

        <attrdef>NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) Description for entity. The "Index Entries" that appear on the NAICS webpage (http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html) are being used to populate this attribute as opposed to the "NAICS Title". While there is a one to one correspondence between NAICS Codes and "NAICS Titles", there is a one to many relationship between NAICS Codes and the "Index Entries". By using the "Index Entries", we have placed the entities that make up this layer into more specific categories; however, the user of this data should be aware that this was not the intended purpose of these "Index Entries". The "Index Entries" were intended as a way to search the NAICS database and as a way of enumerating ways in which establishments falling under the given NAICS Code may be named. Thus, there are often two or more "Index Entries" that are synonyms, for example: "Prisons" and "Penitentiaries". In cases like this, we have standardized on one "Index Entry".  NAICS Descriptions (and NAICS Codes) have been assigned based upon the entity's primary function, regardless of the function that qualified it to be included in this dataset.</attrdef>

Geographic Names Information System ID

A permanent, unique number assigned to a geographic feature for the sole purpose of uniquely identifying that feature as a record in any information system database, dataset, file, or document and for distinguishing it from all other feature records so identified. The number is assigned sequentially (highest existing number plus one) to new records as they are created in the Geographic Names Information System. The number, by design, carries no information or association to the content of the feature record and therefore is not subject to change as attribute values change. Once assigned to a feature, the number is never changed or withdrawn, and never reassigned. The Feature ID can be applied in conjunction with system-unique record identifiers in any database or system, thus providing a national standard common reference identifier across multiple datasets. The Feature ID is stored in the GNIS database as an integer with a maximum of ten digits.
